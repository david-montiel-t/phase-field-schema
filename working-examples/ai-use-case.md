## Problem Statement

Can a standardized phase field schema support FAIR access to high-quality phase field data to support adoption of AI for materials design?

## Context

One of the limiting steps in AI adoption to materials design is availability of large-enough high-quality data and in-particular simulation data for AI system calibration, benchmarking and generalization (ensuring AI models work on unseen data). In fact basing AI-systems on mechanistic or physics informed approaches rather than directly on experimental data can overcome issues such as over-fitting, iterpretability and explainablity [1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2021.117485) . A particular example of an AI technique that is relevant to phase field is active learning (AL), which can greatly reduce the requirement for resource intensive phase-field simulations in the materials design process. In particular, optimizing a generalizable materials design process might involve evaluating many AL algorithms  (such as uncertainty sampling, greed sampling or Bayesian sampling) on unseen data sets and determing which algorthim is the most generalizable. In fact, phase field may be the limiting step in a materials design process and having FAIR access to many relevant data sets for training AI systems is critical.

## Key Issues

- Phase field simulations are resource intensive and can be the limiting step in materials design. Coupling AI with phase field will be vital for materials design.
- Generalized AI models (such as transfer models or AL models) will require large quantities of both training data and unseen data.
- The schema needs to support single simulations as well as set of 1000s of smaller related simulations that might be generated for an AI study. 
- A mechanism to describe the microstructure being generated by the phase field simuations might be required (maybe a link to a microstructure description file or simple keywords) [2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14686996.2016.1194166)
- How to describe the overall structure of the data set? (Outliers, is it balanced, what was the overall thinking?). Maybe a link to a document.
- How to deal with labeling data. Encourage a separate file with labeled data based on sample.
- Has the data been post-processed to a lower dimensionality (with autoencoder, 2-point stats or PCA)

### Solution and Recommendation

- Describe a series of data sets with a single entry wildcard
	- What is varying across the data sets?
- What process is the phase field simulating?
	- Use exisisting materials schema
- Equations described by keywords
- A characterization of the microstructure beyond the equation type
	- Number of phases
	- Number of components
	- Description (key words: spinodal, laminar, dendritic etc)
- Type of free energy (described by key words)
- Is the data set intended for AI?
- What is the size of the data set? (Samples versus features)
- What was the post-processing step (description)
