# AI Use Case

## Problem Statement

Can a standardized phase field schema support FAIR access to
high-quality phase field data to improve adoption of AI for materials
design?

## Context

One of the limiting steps in AI adoption for materials design is the
availability of large-enough high-quality data and in particular
simulation data for AI system calibration, benchmarking and
generalization (ensuring AI models work on unseen data). In fact
basing AI-systems on mechanistic or physics informed approaches rather
than directly on experimental data can overcome issues such as
over-fitting, interpretability and explainablity [1]. A particular
example of an AI technique that is relevant to phase field is active
learning (AL). AL can greatly reduce the need for running exhaustive
resource intensive phase-field parameter studies in the materials
design process. Optimizing a generalizable materials design process
might involve evaluating many AL algorithms (such as uncertainty
sampling, greed sampling or Bayesian sampling) on unseen data sets and
determining which algorithm is the most generalizable. In fact, phase
field may be the limiting step in a materials design process and
having FAIR access to many relevant data sets for training AI systems
is critical to improve its uptake for materials design.

## Key Issues

- Phase field simulations are resource intensive and can be the
  limiting step in materials design. Coupling AI with phase field will
  be vital for materials design.
- Generalized AI models (such as transfer models or AL models) will
  require large quantities of both training data and unseen data.
- The schema needs to support single simulations as well as set of
  1000s of smaller related simulations that might be generated for an
  AI study.
- A mechanism to describe the microstructure being generated by the
  phase field simulations might be required (maybe a link to a
  microstructure description file or simple keywords).
- How to describe the overall structure of the data set? (Outliers, is
  it balanced, what was the overall thinking?). Maybe a link to a
  document?
- How to deal with labeling data. Encourage a separate file with
  labeled data based on sample.
- Has the data been post-processed to a lower dimension (with
  autoencoder, 2-point stats or PCA)

## Solution and Recommendation

- Describe a series of data sets with a single entry wildcard
  - What is varying across the data sets?
- What process is the phase field simulating?
  - Use existing materials schema [2]
- Equations described by keywords
- A characterization of the microstructure beyond the equation type
  - Number of phases
  - Number of components
  - Description (key words: spinodal, laminar, dendritic etc)
- Type of free energy (described by key words)
- Is the data set intended for AI?
- What is the size of the data set? (Samples versus features)
- What was the post-processing step (description)
