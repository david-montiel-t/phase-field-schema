## RO-Crate Examples

This directory is under construction, but the goal is to create a
simple CLI for generating RO-Crate given a config file and associated
data. The `cli` directory includes the Python code for the CLI
tool. Other directories provide example config files and data.

## Installation

The command line tool can be installed using 

    $ pip install .

from the `ro-crate-examples` directory.
