## Notes

### Why use schema.org?

**The digital revolution
Michael Clarke, in Academic and Professional Publishing, 2012**

**Search engine optimization**

Semantic metadata can be used to increase traffic from search engines as such metadata can provide search engines with more information about the content being searched. While the leading search engines maintain their own sets of synonyms, they may not be as complete as those that can be provided by a specialized publisher.

If a unit of content is published, for example, that refers to the acronym ‘ALS’, how is a search engine to know whether the content is about ‘advanced life support’, ‘antilymphocyte globulin’ or ‘amyotrophic lateral sclerosis’? If the last, will that unit of content appear in search queries for ‘Lou Gehrig’s Disease’? Will it know that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a kind of bulbar motor neuron disease and would be relevant to searches on that topic? What about searches for spinal cord diseases? The kind of connections and topical hierarchy that might be obvious to anyone familiar with a topic often elude search engines on all but the more popular searches.

Recently, several of the leading search engines have begun working together, via Schema.org, on the development of standards that will facilitate a greater level of metadata exposure (Guha, 2011).

## Action Items

- Generate a mind map for the schema
- Set up the bones of the publication in overleaf
- Add literature review to google drive
- Traslate sections of the schema into schema.org
