## RO-Crate Example

Using Python to create an RO-Crate

I used the [pyrocrate tests](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py/blob/a551acb4d4084c59e32e2fd79bd82686e6b3aaa2/test/test_model.py#L436) to figure out the code below. Documentation is poor.

[Example of capturing software tools](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/provenance.html#software-used-to-create-files)

```python=
from rocrate.rocrate import ROCrate
from rocrate.model.person import Person
from rocrate.model.entity import Entity
from rocrate.model.computationalworkflow import ComputationalWorkflow

crate = ROCrate()

yaml = crate.add_file("working/pfhub.yaml", properties={
    "name": "PFHub meta data file",
    "encodingFormat": "text/yaml"
})
csv = crate.add_file("working/free_energy_1a.csv", properties={
    "name": "Free Energy",
    "encodingFormat": "text/csv"
})

license_id = "https://spdx.org/licenses/CC0-1.0"
wheeler_id = "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2653-7418"
keller_id = "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2920-8302"



wheeler = crate.add(
    Person(
        crate,
        wheeler_id,
        properties=dict(name="Daniel Wheeler", affiliation="NIST")
    )
)

license = crate.add(Entity(
    crate,
    identifier=license_id,
    properties={
        "@type": "CreativeWork",
        "name": "CC0-1.0",
        "description": "Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal",
        "url": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"
    }
    )
)

crate.license = license
crate.root_dataset["author"] = wheeler
crate.description = "An example of generating an ro-crate from a PFHub result, for now this is only focused on the computational platform, environment and implementation"

#from metadata list on workflow hub https://about.workflowhub.eu/docs/metadata-list/
crate.root_dataset["title"] = "PFHub title: fipy_1a_travis"
```

```python=
keller = crate.add(
    Person(
        crate,
        keller_id,
        properties=dict(name="Trevor Keller", affiliation="NIST")
    )
)
workflow = crate.add_workflow('https://github.com/usnistgov/FiPy-spinodal-decomposition-benchmark/blob/main/periodic/cahn-hilliard.py')
workflow.programmingLanguage = "Python 3.10"
workflow["creator"] = keller
workflow["dateCreated"] = "2017-01-09"
crate.add(workflow)
crate.write("exp_crate")
```

## Review of "Recording provenance of workflow runs with RO-Crate"


- Presents Workflow Run RO-Crate (WRROC)
- 3 new profiles
- Has concept of retrospective and prospective provenance built into profiles
- RO-Crate describes a directory structure in its simplest form
- The Workflow Run RO-Crate is a set of 3 profiles that extends RO-Crate
- WRROC strikes a balance between actionable and readable. The profiles are types.
- [List of requirements](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/requirements)
	- Containers
	- memory usage
	- config files
	- env files
	- timings
	- success / failure status
	- inputs / outputs
	- versioning
	- scripts
	- parameters
- Each requirement is linked ot a github issue!
- 3 types of workflow run crates
	- Process run crate (describe the exectusion as one or more tools)
		- includes human executions
		- poorly defined
		- exectution of multiple software apps
		- allows "composite" data sets
	- workflow run crate (predefined workflow)
		- well defined
	- provenance run crate (workflow computation including internal details)
		- internal details such as inputs / outputs between steps
- Designed to have workflows rerun -- reproducible
- inheritance mechanism allows reuse of common parts of descriptions
- 7 different workflow systems now using WRROCs (includig Galaxy)
- All crates are included in Provenance Run WRROC.
- Supposedly [runcrate](https://github.com/ResearchObject/runcrate) should allow WRROC to actually be executed?
	- Documentation is poor though
- Allows data to be described at very different levels of granularity
- runcrate toolkit will be expanded it says
