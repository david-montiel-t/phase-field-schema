1. Current state of the RO-Crate example (work with Austyn Nguyen)
    - We are a lot more comfortable with RO-Crate and the possibilities
    - [New RO-Crate example](https://gist.github.com/wd15/4baf6e83aef80ff48af0535f2c8262be) 
    - [HTML view of RO-Crate](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/wd15/4baf6e83aef80ff48af0535f2c8262be/raw/7113e0cd239fc3199040078e8784eb0d2f657a44/ro-crate-preview.html)
    - [Graph view](https://json-ld.org/playground/#startTab=tab-expanded&json-ld=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fwd15%2F4baf6e83aef80ff48af0535f2c8262be%2Fraw%2Fd49c12b4a4bbcd9397bcae42848b5df989b879f6%2Fro-crate-metadata.json)
    - The benchmark spec is included alongside an environment file, inputs and outputs as well. 
    - `CreateAction` is the top level entity for the actual workflow
    - See [this](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/profiles/0.5/process_run_crate/) for more descriptions of how it works
    - [Bioschemas also used for `ComputationalTool`](https://bioschemas.org/types/)
1. We can push any new schema to be a subset of Workflow run ro-crate [here](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-terms/) 
    - However, this is not always necessary
    - [DefinedTerm](https://schema.org/DefinedTerm) gives a lot of possibilities
    - I think we need to think about adding a `specification` or `problemDefinition` field to the top-level of the exisisting RO-Crate terms. Possibly augement a `Dataset` to have a `governingEquations` field.
    - [The existing RO-Crate extra terms](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-terms/tree/master/workflow-run#terms-in-detail)
        - Notice that these have a lot of possibilities to add containers
        - A lot of the existing augmentations for Workflow run are for `CreateAction`, which I've demonstrated works well for our needs. 
2. Gave a short presentation to the [Workflow Run RO-Crate group]((https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/)) about our use case and recieved some usefule feedback.
5. Galaxy's tutorial: [RO-Crate - Introduction](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-intro/tutorial.html)
6. Ideas
