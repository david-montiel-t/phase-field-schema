 6. Proposal document revisions
    - Goals / outcomes / impacts / deliverables revisions
    - Short term, medium term, long term
 7. Action items for next meeting
    1. More participants? [DW]
       - One extra from commercial code?
         - OpenPhase - Martin Tegeler
         - COMSOL - Alex Guo
         - Pace3D - Britta Nestler, KIT
         - MDF individual
    2. Determine some viable use cases [Everyone]
       - AI use case
       - PFHub benchmark use case
       - Complement to a published paper to better understand it
       - Translation between input files for different codes/frameworks
       - Data publication as a first-class research output
       - Apples-to-apples comparisons between codes (for correctness or performance)
    3. Contribute ideas to schema [DW, Kasra]
       - What fields are required?
       - Categorize things (software frameworks, numerical methods and problem specs)
       - List of existing relevant simulation schemas (e.g. Sumatra) 
       - Are there any other simulation schemas?

## Notes

1. What relevance does a metadata file have for a dataset that's too large to redistribute?
2. 

## Action Items / Follow Up

## Current Work Plan (feel free to comment below items)

1. **Generate ~~and finalize~~ an initial schema**:
   - Use the [existing PFHub LinkML
     repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/pfhub-schema) as a basis
     for generating the schema.
   - Determine use cases (how would other researcher use phase field data).
   - Finalize a schema over first few months of WG

2. **Implement web tool, templates or command line to generate ~~schema files~~ metadata records**
   - Develop a web tool for generating ~~schema files~~ metadata records similar to
    [codemeta.json](https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/)
   - Create prefilled examples of the YAML / JSON files.
   - Co-opt existing or use new command line tool to query repositories, ask
    questions, populate templates and push entries to Zenodo or similar service.
   - A possible long term goal would be a phase field registry similar to PFHub.

3. **Develop working examples**
   - An example using an existing PFHub benchmark result and integrated
    into the PFHub registry.
   - An example using a study of numerical convergence using a series of
    simulations at varying discretizations.
   - An example phase field schema and associated data published in
    conjunction with a phase field publication.

4. **Approach wider phase field community for feedback**
   - Present examples and tools at CHiMaD phase field workshops
   - Present same at the MaRDA meeting
   - Present at larger conference.
   - Publication describing schema and case study examples.
