# Phase Field Schema Working Group

Organizational material for the MaRDA working group focused on developing and implementing a schema to improve the provenance of phase field data.

## Proposal

### Motivation

 - talk about pfhub
 - existing schema linkml
 - ties in with extraction and data dictionaries
 - simulation data has not been addressed
 - deliver dataset documentation in-band (data that travels with the
 - lightweight ontology to describe phase filed simulations in an accompanying file blah
 - focus on the computational resources, numerical methods used, physical model, describe the PDE
 - FAIR, findable and accesible only
 - 

### Work Plan

### Goals and Expected Impact

1. **blah blah
  - blah
  - blah

### Deliverables

Within 12 months of the commencement of the working group, we will deliver

- A Working Group Note, published on the MaRDA Alliance website
- A proof-of-concept implementation of I, II and III
